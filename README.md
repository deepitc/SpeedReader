# SpeedReader

The Speed Reader project is a Java program that utilizes graphical interface classes and a DrawingPanel class to create a speed reading tool. 
The program presents a series of words quickly in succession, allowing the reader to focus on a single word at a time and preventing subvocalization. 
This technique, known as Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP), is designed to increase reading speed and improve reading efficiency. 
The program includes a WordGenerator class that reads in text from a file and logs statistics about the text, as well as methods for rendering and animating the text on screen.
